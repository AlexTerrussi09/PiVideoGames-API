    "description_raw": 'Not all post-apocalyptic stories begin in the burned wastelands, this time nuclear and chemical locked up survivors in the Moscow Subway, and player will take the place of Artyom, one of the survivors from the VDNKh, adoptive son of the station commander, and taking upon himself the task to deliver information about the Dark Ones to the Polis, the capital of subway, after the special operative from Spartans named Hunter went missing, after he ventured to gather information on the Hive – living space of the Dark Ones.\r\n' +
      'Dark tunnels of broken subway create a claustrophobic atmosphere, where good and bad people alike are forced to bond. Closely following original book, Metro 2033 introducing bullets as currency. Players can exchange one type of bullets for another one, but it’s still ammo and will be wasted with inaccurate aim. It’s a first person shooter that will allow players not only see how broken apart can society become but to explore such society and ruins of the city above the underground settlement. Various monsters and mutants are not the only threat to the players, but humans as well. FPS with some stealth sections, Metro 2033 will show you every historical enemy type: bandits, Communists, and Nazis.'
